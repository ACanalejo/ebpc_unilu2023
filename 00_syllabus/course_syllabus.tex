\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course description}\label{course-description}}

Elections in Europe have become increasingly unpredictable in the last
decades. In Germany, for example, the government negotiations escalated
from one month in 2013 to almost six months after the entry of the
radical party AfD in the \emph{Bundestag} in 2017. In other European
countries, such as Spain or the Netherlands, the number of parliamentary
parties has doubled in the last twenty years, while the Italian party
system has arguably collapsed twice in the same period. How has this
situation come about? What are its consequences? These changes are not
random but driven by societal transformations and the strategies of
political actors, such as social movements and new challenger parties.
In addition, they have not affected all of Europe equally but depend on
factors that vary across countries and over time. This seminar will
review the different `transformation waves' that have shaped Western
European party systems from the 1960s until now. It will then try to
make sense of these changes by exploring the most relevant (electoral)
demand-side and supply-side explanations discussed in the literature.
The goal is to provide students with the conceptual and empirical tools
to analyze the behaviour of voters and parties by following the
evolution of Western European party systems from a comparative
perspective.

\hypertarget{course-organization}{%
\section{Course organization}\label{course-organization}}

The course consists of a weekly seminar that will run during the Spring
term of 2023 (February 22nd - May 31st). The substantive focus of the
seminars is organized in four blocks. The first block will introduce
students to the main concepts in the study of parties and party systems
and review the main theories of party system formation. The second block
will review the different transformational waves that have affected
Western European party systems from the 1960s until now. The third block
will delve into the literature on political behaviour and party
competition to focus on the mechanisms behind party system stability and
change. The final block will deal with the measurement of party system
change and its normative implications.

\hypertarget{learning-outcomes}{%
\section{Learning outcomes}\label{learning-outcomes}}

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{(Knowledge)} Identify the main theoretical approaches to the
  study of party system formation and change, integrate supply and
  demand-side explanations for the study of electoral outcomes, and use
  the most relevant indicators to assess electoral change.
\item
  \textbf{(Competence)} Critically reflect on the different theories and
  methods reviewed during the course to assess the predictive validity
  of different approaches in time and space.
\item
  \textbf{(Research skills)} Read scientific articles with a critical
  perspective, develop their own hypotheses and connect them with the
  relevant literature, and design feasible ways to test them.
\item
  \textbf{(Communication)} Communicate complex concepts effectively to a
  broad audience, alone or in collaboration with colleagues.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{teaching-policy}{%
\section{Teaching policy}\label{teaching-policy}}

This course is designed as a seminar, not a lecture. It aims to foster
and refine critical thinking by providing a collaborative learning
environment. The lecturer will give a broad overview of the subject
matter in each lesson to guide the discussion, which the students will
drive. Therefore, students are expected to study the mandatory readings
before class. Slides are not intended to replace given texts and will
only be distributed after each session.

\hypertarget{evaluation}{%
\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}}

\hypertarget{mandatory-requirements-4-credits}{%
\subsection{Mandatory requirements (4
credits)}\label{mandatory-requirements-4-credits}}

To receive the credits, students are expected to fulfil the following
criteria:

\hypertarget{attend-all-the-sessions.}{%
\subsubsection{1. Attend all the
sessions.}\label{attend-all-the-sessions.}}

Attendance is mandatory. Students can miss a maximum of two sessions.
Missing more sessions without a justified certificate of absence implies
failing the course.

\hypertarget{study-the-mandatory-readings-before-each-session.}{%
\subsubsection{2. Study the mandatory readings before each
session.}\label{study-the-mandatory-readings-before-each-session.}}

\emph{Studying = reading + critical thinking}. Students can find the
texts in the materials folder in OLAT.

\hypertarget{write-two-response-papers.}{%
\subsubsection{3. Write two response
papers.}\label{write-two-response-papers.}}

Students must select two sessions and write a short response paper
(500-700 words) to the mandatory readings of the session.

A good response paper should:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Start with a short summary of the paper}. It should not be a
  summary of the content but of the main thesis and findings of the
  paper.
\item
  \emph{Identify the contribution.} It should state clearly what bigger
  problem or question the author is contributing to addressing.
\item
  \emph{Evaluate the argument from a critical perspective.} I should
  identify the main contributions and limitations of the paper and
  proposes ways in which these limitations should be addressed either by
  the author or in future research.
\end{itemize}

Some of the readings may be less suited to this structure, for example,
book chapters or literature reviews. In these cases, the students are
encouraged to develop different critical evaluations of the text, such
as developing some of the open questions or hypotheses laid out in the
text.

The suggested readings are not mandatory. However, the students will
benefit from linking them to the main text in their response papers.

The \textbf{submission rules} are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Students must upload their response papers to the \emph{Response
  papers} folder in OLAT.
\item
  The deadline for submitting the response paper is the \textbf{Sunday
  before the corresponding session at noon (12:00)}.
\item
  Students cannot send papers for \emph{session 01} and \emph{session
  14}, which are free-readings sessions. See
  \protect\hyperlink{course-schedule}{Course schedule}.
\item
  One of the response papers must be submitted for a session before the
  \textbf{spring break (10-16th April)} and one afterwards.
\item
  The response papers cannot be sent for the same session as the
  student's presentation or discussion.
\item
  The file must be in Word. The title should include the session's
  number followed by the student's surname in capital letters and the
  response paper number (either 1 or 2). For example:
  \emph{session04\_CANALEJO\_1}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conduct-one-presentation.}{%
\subsubsection{4. Conduct one
presentation.}\label{conduct-one-presentation.}}

Presentations can be done alone or in groups of two or three students,
depending on the number of students taking the course. The schedule will
be decided upon the session
\protect\hyperlink{introduction-to-the-course}{Introduction to the
course}.

Presenters must critically re-examine the mandatory readings of the
session to locate a troubling or unsatisfactory element, then propose a
solution including a theoretical motivation and a feasible research
design. A discussion of the proposal will follow the presentation.
Presenters must upload the slides of the presentation \textbf{at least
24 hours before the presentation} to the \emph{Presentations} folder in
OLAT to allow the discussant to prepare. The file with the presentation
slides can be in the preferred format of the presenter (e.g., ppt, pdf,
etc.). The title should include the session's number followed by the
student's surname in capital letters. For example:
\emph{session06\_CANALEJO}. \textbf{The presentation should last between
15 and 25 minutes (\(\approx\) 20 minutes)}.

For more information, see the section
\protect\hyperlink{guidelines-for-the-presentation}{Guidelines for the
presentation}. The use of this presentation to develop an independent
research project is encouraged (e.g.~future seminar papers or thesis).

\emph{Sessions 01, 02 and 14} are free from presentations.

\hypertarget{serve-as-discussant-of-one-presentation.}{%
\subsubsection{5. Serve as discussant of one
presentation.}\label{serve-as-discussant-of-one-presentation.}}

Each presentation will be assigned a discussant. The discussant must
study the research proposal of the presenter(s) in advance and provide
feedback after the presentation (\(\approx\) \textbf{5 minutes}). The
feedback must be constructive. It should be directed to clarify the
proposal's main concepts and propose ways to improve the design. The
questions of the discussant should serve to guide the discussion among
the presenter and the rest of the audience, but the audience can
(should) raise their own questions too.

\hypertarget{participate-actively-in-class.}{%
\subsubsection{6. Participate actively in
class.}\label{participate-actively-in-class.}}

Active engagement involves intervening during the discussion with
original ideas and open questions and linking the content of the
readings to the debate. Students are also encouraged to bring debates
that exceed the content of the session, but it is linked to the general
topic of the course.

\hypertarget{grading-policy}{%
\subsection{Grading policy}\label{grading-policy}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  40\% of the grade is determined by the response papers.
\item
  40\% of the grade is determined by the presentation.
\item
  20\% of the grade is jointly determined by the quality and quantity of
  the participation in class and the discussion of the presentation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{seminar-paper-6-credits}{%
\subsection{Seminar paper (6 credits)}\label{seminar-paper-6-credits}}

Students can choose to write a seminar paper to obtain six extra
credits. The seminar paper must have between 5500 and 6500 words.
Students can choose if they want to write an empirical or a theoretical
paper. The topic should be agreed upon between the instructor and the
student. To this end, students are asked to write a paper outline of 1-2
pages consisting of the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Introduction of the topic
\item
  Research question
\item
  Academic and societal relevance
\item
  Theories (and hypotheses, if applicable)
\item
  Approach and structure of the paper (including a tentative empirical
  design, if applicable)
\end{itemize}

The deadline for the submission of the paper outline is \textbf{May 1st
2023}.

The deadline for the submission of the seminar paper is
\textbf{September 1st 2023}.

Please refer to ``The (Pro-)Seminar Paper'' section of the guidelines
for
\href{https://www.unilu.ch/fileadmin/fakultaeten/ksf/institute/polsem/Dok/Studium/2016-Jan_Guidelines_Booklet_engl.pdf}{Academic
Research and Writing of the Department of Political Science.} for more
details.

\hypertarget{office-hours}{%
\section{Office hours}\label{office-hours}}

Student meetings can be held during the instructor's \textbf{weekly
office hours}, scheduled each \textbf{Tuesday} (starting from February
21st until June 6th inclusive) \textbf{between 13.30 and 15.30}. If any
student wants to make use of the office hours, she must book a time slot
via e-mail:
\href{mailto:alvaro.canalejo@unilu.ch}{\nolinkurl{alvaro.canalejo@unilu.ch}}.
The office is in \textbf{room 3.A12}.

Any student can send an e-mail during office hours without scheduling a
meeting for quick questions.

\hypertarget{guidelines-for-the-presentation}{%
\section{Guidelines for the
presentation}\label{guidelines-for-the-presentation}}

A good presentation should include the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  An outline of the presentation.
\item
  A brief summary of the readings, including their main argument,
  methodology (if applicable) and contribution. It should focus on those
  aspects of the text that the student(s) aim to analyze later. It
  should never be a full summary of the content.
\item
  A critique of the argument or the research design.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some examples are an inconsistent logic, flawed conceptualizations
    (e.g., concepts that do not travel well across contexts), limited
    external validity (e.g., results that do not apply in other
    contexts), limited internal validity (e.g., poorly identified causal
    relationship, for example, due to omitted variables), limited
    relevance, etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Propose a feasible research design to overcome these limitations or
  build upon them.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Matching the previous examples, some examples are a better-built
    argument that leads to different implications, an original
    conceptualization that performs better, outlining a research design
    that would prove the results valid in a different or wider setting,
    or a research design that controlled for potential confounders.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The presentation is evaluated based on its clarity, the understanding of
the original readings' concepts, the critical evaluation's depth, the
congruency between the critique and the research proposal's aim to solve
it, the argumentation and the ability to discuss the discussant's
points. For more guidelines, see the guidelines on
\href{https://www.unilu.ch/fileadmin/fakultaeten/ksf/institute/polsem/Dok/Studium/2016-Jan_Guidelines_Booklet_engl.pdf}{Academic
