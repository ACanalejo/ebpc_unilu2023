**Now, what about you** :grey_question:

::: incremental
-   What is your name?

-   What is your background?

-   Why did you decide to take this course and what do you expect from it?
:::

## The course {#sec-course_intro}

*Electoral Behaviour and Party Competition: Continuity and Change in WE*

::: incremental
-   So why this name?

1.  It is a general course on political behaviour

2.  It is also a general course on party competition

3.  Specifically, it looks at the intersection of the two

    -   Because of that, it may lack some content on political behaviour beyond parties (e.g., media effects)

    -   And it might also lacks some content on parties beyond political competition (e.g., party organization)

4.  Instead, because theories may always sound a little bit disconnected from reality at a first sight, it attempts to link voters and parties through the comparison of **Western European (WE) party systems, their patterns of continuity and change**

**QUESTION**

You might know that the Swiss federal elections are close, **do you know of recent electoral changes in Switzerland?**
