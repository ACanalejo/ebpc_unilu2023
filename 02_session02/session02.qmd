### Understanding political parties

::: incremental
-   **Normatively**, they are channels of expressions. That is, they are an *instrument*, or an agency, *for representing the people* by *expressing their demands* [@Sartori1976, p. 24]

-   **Descriptively**, a political party is an organization that *competes for votes in elections* to *achieve office* with the aim of *implementing their preferred policies* [adapted from @strom_behavioral_1990]
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Three behavioral assumptions [@strom_behavioral_1990]:

::: incremental
1.  Vote-seeking

2.  Office-seeking

3.  Policy-seeking
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ Do all the parties fit these criteria?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The classification of political parties

Let's play a game!

::: incremental

- Let's shuffle in groups of two

- Find a match with someone from another country (if possible)

- You have three minutes to group political parties of your countries together

- Then, explain why you did it!

:::

---

### The classification of political parties

Possible criteria [@Mair1998]:

::: incremental
1.  Names

2.  Ideology

3.  Shared origins [(eg. socialist parties)]{style="color:grey"}

4.  Ascription to transnational federations [(eg. European federations)]{style="color:grey"}
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ Alternative or complementary criteria?
:::

---

### The party families [@Camia2012]

::: incremental
1.  Socialist and communist parties

2.  Religious and people's parties

3.  Agrarian parties [(eg...)]{style="color:grey"}

4.  Regionalist/independentist parties [(eg...)]{style="color:grey"}
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ Can you think of other party families?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The classification of political parties

::: incremental
Why is important to classify parties :grey_question:

-   It helps **to answer questions!**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ Therefore, the **question** should guide the selection of the classification criterion
:::

::: incremental
-  Most commonly: [**ideology**]{style="color:red"}
:::

## Understanding electoral competition {#sec-competition}

Downs [-@Downs1957] introduced the spatial models of electoral competition 

::: incremental
-  Why **spatial**?
    + Mathematically, parties compete in dimensions treated as a vector space
- What is the main **dimension of competition**?
    + [L]{style="color:red"}-[R]{style="color:blue"}
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
[0]{style="color:red"}------------[5]{style="color:gray"}------------[10]{style="color:blue"}
:::

---

### Understanding electoral competition

::: incremental
- This framework help to understand patterns of **interaction between parties**
- Important implications for **electoral behaviour**
    + We will see more over the course!
:::


## Understanding party systems {#sec-systems}

- What are party systems?

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ The patterned interaction between parties [@mair1997party]
:::

---

### Understanding party systems

Typologies:

::: incremental
-   Duverger (1954)

-   Dahl (1966)

-   Blondel (1968)

-   Rokkan (1968)
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ **Sartori** [-@Sartori1976] goes beyond the simple rule of aggregation to tap into (some of) the components that define the patterns of competition
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Figure 2: Party systems typologies. Originally in @mair1997party](ps_typology.png){fig-align="left"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The classification of party systems [@Sartori1976]

::: incremental
-   Two criteria:

    1.  Number of parties

        → How do you measure the number of parties?

    2.  Ideological polarization

        → What does it mean?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
[0]{style="color:red"}------------[5]{style="color:gray"}------------[10]{style="color:blue"}
:::

---

### The classification of party systems [@Sartori1976]

::: incremental

-   Ideal types:

    1.  Two-party systems [(eg., UK until 1990s)]{style="color:grey"}
    2.  Moderate pluralism [(e.g., Denmark)]{style="color:grey"}
    3.  Polarized pluralism [(e.g., Italy until 1990s)]{style="color:grey"}
    4.  Predominant party-system [(e.g., Ireland until recently)]{style="color:grey"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Implications for electoral competition

::: incremental
-   Implications for patterns of alternation in government

    -   Prevailing pattern of alternation [(wholesome, partial, non-alternation)]{style="color:grey"}
    -   Stability [(innovation vs familiarity)]{style="color:grey"}
    -   Governing parties [(insiders vs outsiders)]{style="color:grey"}

-   Two ideal types:

    1.  **Open** competition
    2.  **Closed** competition
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  {auto-animate="true" auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"}

::: {style="margin-top: 100px;"}
"none the less, any explanation of the degree of closure of any given structure of competition must necessarily focus particular attention on the strategies of the parties themselves." [@mair1997party p. 213]
:::

##  {auto-animate="true" auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"}

::: {style="margin-top: 200px;"}
"none the less, any explanation of the degree of closure of any given structure of competition must necessarily focus particular attention on **the strategies of the parties** themselves." [@mair1997party p. 213]
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Implications for electoral outcomes

::: incremental

- *TO SUMMARIZE*

    → Important distinction between political **parties** and **party systems** [(**agency-based** vs **system-based** approaches)]{style="color:grey"}

-   What are the implications of this distinction for **party system change**?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Electoral change $\not=$ party system change
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
[**Why?**]{style="color:red"}
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ Altering parties and the number/identity of parties *vs* **altering the interaction patterns between parties**
:::

---

### Other implications

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
→ What [other implications]{style="color:red"} of party systems [beyond the electoral arena]{style="color:red"}?
:::
:::

::: incremental
-   Think of **voters**

-   Think of **policies**

-   Think of **democracy** (i.e., *the polity*)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What are the problems with Sartori's typology?

::: incremental
-   Emerging new competition patterns [(difficult to accommodate within his categories)]{style="color:grey"}

-   No insights about multidimensional competition patterns [(i.e., what happens if there is more than left and right?)]{style="color:grey"}

-   Other potential problems :grey_question:
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Conclusion

::: incremental

-   Distinction between political **parties** and **party systems** [(although mutually dependent)]{style="color:grey"}

-   Distinction between **electoral change** and **party system change** [(although mutually dependent)]{style="color:grey"}

- **Party strategies** and the **structure of the party systems** interact and impact ***electoral competition***
