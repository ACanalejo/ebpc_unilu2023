## Overview of the readings

::: incremental

- Opinions

- Issues or questions

- Interesting/problematic topics

:::

## Structure of the session

- The formation of party systems

- Institutions and party systems

- The political consequences of electoral rules

# The formation of party systems {#sec-ps_formation}

## What do we mean by party system formation?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

*The process through which party systems acquire the characteristics that define them*

::: 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
→ What characteristics?
:::


## Two major approaches

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
- The sociological approach
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- The **institutional approach**
:::

# Institutions and party systems {#sec-institutions}

## Institutions and party-systems

::: incremental

- What do we mean by institutions?

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ The rules of the game
:::

::: incremental
- What institutions are relevant for party systems and elections?
:::


::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ **Electoral rules**
:::


::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ Others?

# The political consequences of electoral rules {#sec-elec_rules}

## The Duverger 'laws'

::: incremental

1. "The simple-majority single-ballot system favours the two-party system." [@Duverger1959, p. 217]

     → *Duverger's law*

2. Proportional representation (PR) electoral systems favour multi-party systems [@Duverger1959, p. 239]

     → *Duverger's hypothesis*

3. What about two-round majority systems?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ According to Duverger, it favours multiparty systems too (*why?*)
:::

## Direct vs. indirect effects

::: incremental

1. **Direct effects**
::: 

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ *Mechanical effects*
::: 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}    
Generalization (1): Higher district magnitude leads to a larger number of parties and *vice versa*
::: 

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Generalization (2): M + 1 rule [@Cox1997]
::: 

## Direct vs. indirect effects

::: incremental
2. **Indirect effects**
::: 

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ *Psychological effects*
::: 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}    
*Voters and parties' behavior anticipates the mechanical effects of the electoral rules*
::: 

## Direct vs. indirect effects

::: incremental

"There is thus an **endogeneity between the mechanical and psychological factors**" [@benoit_duvergers_2006, p. 75]

::: 

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
→ What does [endogeneity]{style="color:red"} means?
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
-  ***Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)*** can help us to identify endogeneity sources and ways to remove this endeogenity [@pearl2009causality]
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ Under what conditions would you expect [weaker psychological effects]{style="color:red"}?
:::

## Any other [endogeneity problem]{style="color:red"} in the relationship between party systems and electoral rules?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ The electoral rules themselves! [eg., @Boix1999]
::: 

## Other institutions?

::: incremental

- Federalism

- Direct democracy mechanisms

- Presidentialism vs. parliamentarism

- ...

::: 

## Conclusion

::: incremental

- **Sociological** and **institutional** factors shape party systems

- Among the **institutional factors**, [electoral rules]{style="color:red"} play a major role

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}

- We can distinguish two main mechanisms:

    → *Mechanical*
  
    → *Psychological*
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
In practice, the theoretical **distinction between mechanical and psychological effects** suffers from ***endogeneity problems***
:::


## Conclusion

::: incremental

The same occur with the **distinction between institutional and sociological factors** [(endogeneity is ubiquitous in the social world!)]{style="color:gray"} 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
→  Therefore, **how can we tackle this problem?**
:::
::: 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
***It is always important to understand the social context in which institutions emerge!*** [(next session)]{style="color:gray"}
