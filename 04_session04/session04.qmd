::: 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

# Cleavage theory: from lines of conflict to political competition {#sec-cleavage}

## What is a cleavage? [@Lipset1967a]

::: incremental

- There may be several political conflicts characterising the transition from feudal to the modern state

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
→ [Why some become **more relevant** than others?]{style="color:red"}
:::
::: 

::: incremental

1. Initial distribution of power

2. Strategies and alliances

3. External factors

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ *IMP:* ***Overlapping vs. cross-cutting cleavages***
::: 

## The process of cleavage formation

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Three **sufficient and necessary conditions** [@Bartolini1990]:

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

***Social divisions***

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

→ ***identity formation*** [(relevance of mass organizations)]{style="color:grey"}

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

→ ***politicization*** [(top-down vs. bottom-up)]{style="color:grey"}

:::

## Cleavages and party systems

::: incremental

- UK vs Switzerland

- Spain vs. Italy

- **Other examples?**

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}
→ [What about the interaction between **cleavages and institutions**?]{style="color:red"}
:::
:::

## Summary

::: incremental

- Party systems are historically rooted in the state formation process of each country

- When social conflicts become politicized, they become cleavages

- In contrast to more contingent social conflicts [(e.g., COVID derived issues)]{style="color:grey"}, cleavages are rooted in the identity of politically relevant social groups

:::

## Summary

::: incremental

- They explain the origin and characteristics of parties and party system

- Cleavages and institutions are mutually self-reinforcing, and hel to explain the stability of electoral competition in Western democracies
