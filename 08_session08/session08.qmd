# The spatial model of party competition {#sec-spatial}

---

To recall:

- The spatial (or economic) theory of voting and party competition was proposed by **Downs** [-@Downs1957]

- He proposed an analysis of elections as **electoral markets** in which the **demand side** was the electorate and the **supply side** was the competing parties

- In his initial **model**, based on the USA context, two parties competed to **maximize voters** over **one dimension**

- We will use this basic set-up for simplicity, although **Europe** is mostly characterize by **multi-party systems**

---



What do we mean by a **dimension**?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

  1. Mathematically → a vector that represents a a set of preferences over a continuum

  2. In our setup → policy preferences that range from 0 (the left) to 10 (the right)

***Remarks***:

  1. Models are simplifications of reality
  
  2. "***All models are wrong, but some are useful***" (G. Box)
  
  3. The key for interpreting any model: understanding the assumptions

---

The **main set of assumptions of the Downsian model** is that parties aim to **maximize votes** to win elections

<br>

The second set of assumptions is that each voter have a fixed policy preference over the continuum (**preference distribution**) and **will vote to the closest party if there is one closest alternative**

---

- Each party depart from a different side of the spectrum (representing **each side of a cleavage**)

- Then, each political party takes the **policy stance** (i.e., position over the continuum) that maximizes its chances of winning the election by **approximating the preference of the median voter** (i.e., the preference that leaves an equal number of voters at each side of the distribution)

---

- Let's suppose that we have two parties, each of them representing each side of the left-right ideological dimension, that want to maximize their chances of winning the next election by moderating their positions

  1. The first party is a **centre-left party**, that takes a value of **4**

  2. The second party is a **centre-right party**, that takes a value of **6**

  3. **Preferences are normally distributed** within the population

- Let's play with this set-up!

::: incremental

  1. What happens if we add a **centre-party** to the model?
  
  2. And if we add a **extreme-right party**?
  
  3. And if we add a **extreme-right and extreme-left party**?
  
  4. What happened if the distribution is slightly **skewed to the right** (i.e., more voters in the left)?
  
  5. And **to the left** (i.e., more voters in the right)?
  
  6. What happens if **extreme voters are apathetic**?
  
  7. What happens if the **centre-right party is in government and the economy is doing good**?
  
  8. And if **the economy is doing bad**?
  
:::

---


- In sum, **the Downsian model**, as well as models in general, are **a tool that help us understand the reality**, by providing means to summarise (theoretical) expectations graphically and mathematically

::: incremental

- **Representing cleavages with dimensions of competition** help us to **analyse the interaction between parties (i.e., party systems)** as well as **parties and voters (i.e., electoral competition)**, under a given set of conditions

:::

---


- So far we have only discussed a situation in where two parties compete over a single dimension

- However, we know that **cleavages can overlap or cross-cut each other**

- If they don't completely overlap, we can interpret the **cross-cutting cleavage as a second dimension**

::: incremental

- Let's say, for example, that two parties compete in **Catalonia (Spain)** where there are two important dimensions

  1. The **left-right economic dimension** is rooted in the **class cleavage**
  
  2. The **pro-independence - anti-independence** is rooted in the **centre-periphery cleavage**

:::
  
---


- We have **two hypothetical scenarios**:

  1. In **Figure 2** the two dimensions are **partially coincidental/overlapping** 
  
      + This could be the case if the second dimension was **not at all salient/divisive**
      
  2. In **Figure 3** the two dimensions are **completely independent** (i.e., orthogonal in mathematical terms)
  
      + This could be the case if the second dimension was **extremely salient/divisive**

This lead to a series of ***implications***, most importantly:

  1. As the **dimensions** become **more cross-cutting**, the **space opened for new parties** becomes **larger**
  
  2. The **larger** becomes the **space opened for new parties**, the **party system** will tend to be **more fragmented**
  
  3. As **more dimensions** cross-cut each other, the **space opened for new parties** becomes **larger** and the **party system** will tend to be **more fragmented**

# A value-based cleavage? The cultural dimension {#sec-cleavage}

---

- The **left-right (or first order) dimension**, which is the most used dimension in European political studies, captures preferences **deeply rooted in the class cleavage**

- The rest of cleavages discussed by Lipset and Rokkan [-@Lipset1967a] have country-specific manifestations and, with some exceptions, have weakened with time

---

  1. The **state-church cleavage** has eroded as a result of growing secularization
  
  2. The **urban-rural cleavage** (although re-emerging according to some scholars) have eroded with massive migration from the country side to the city
  
  3. The **centre-periphery cleavage** is the only exception, since it has become even stronger in some cases (e.g., Catalonia in Spain or Scotland in the UK)
  
---

None of the traditional cleavages, however, explains the rise of new left and new right parties

::: incremental

- This has led scholars to **two alternative conclusions**:

  1. Either **cleavages have lost their explanatory power** and political competition dynamics are now driven by issue voting, short-term strategies and opportunistic/charismatic leadership
  
  2. Or a **new cleavage** is structuring the political conflict in Europe

:::

---

[Scholars situated on the latter tradition argue that **Western Europe is increasingly structured by a two-dimensional political space**]{style="color:red"}

---

There is a series of names that different scholars have given to the new cleavage:

  1. Integration-demarcation cleavage [e.g., @Kriesi2006]
  
  2. Universalistic-communitarian  cleavage [e.g., @Bornschier2010]
  
  3. Green/alternative/libertarian(**GAL**)-Tradition-authority-national(**TAN**) [e.g., @Hooghe2018b]
  
<br>  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

All of these accounts coincide on some **basic features**

:::

---

  1. The cleavage is rooted on  (1) the expansion of **educational rights**, (2) the transition **from an industrial to a post-industrial society** and (3) the process of **globalization**
  
::: incremental  
  
  2. These processes (and others) have generated groups of **winners** and **losers**, i.e. people that have benefited or been harmed as a result, that constitute the two sides of the conflict
  
  3. The cleavage is manifested in opposing **cultural values and preferences**. Losers tend to manifest traditional, nativist an authoritarian-oriented values while winners tend to support progressive, multiculturalist and libertarian policies
  
  4. The parties that better represent each of the poles of this conflict are the **new left parties** for the winners and the **PRR** parties for the losers

:::

## Response papers

"I disagree with the fact that both articles consider the cleavage around globalization as a «new one». Except if they tell us what they mean by «new», I see no reason why the cleavage should be new. Since the very beginning of the creation of the EU there has been Euroscepticism, and at that time it was, if not stronger, at least as strong as it is nowadays" (Apolline Bouly)

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

"I think we should globally not overestimate the impact of this new cleavage, however, we also should not underestimate how disturbing the arrival of new issues is in general (not only globalization, but also for instance environmental problems)" (Apolline Bouly)

# Cross-country variation and current trends {#sec-trends}

---

The ***second-dimension*** is **not completely orthogonal** to the first dimension

- **Traditional parties** (i.e., mainstream) have sometimes been **dominant on the second-dimension** too (e.g., Social Democratic parties that accommodated the demands of NSM)

---

There are important regional differences:

  1. In ***NWE***, the second and first dimensions are **more orthogonal** and **new parties** have been the main drivers of the shift to the second dimension
  
  2. In ***SE***, the second and first dimensions are **less orthogonal** and **traditional** parties have been often *owners* of second-dimension issues

## Austria vs. Greece 15 years ago

![Figure 5: Austria 2006 and Greece 2007 compared / Source: Bornschier (2010) and Hutter and Kriesi (2019) respectively](aus2006_gre2007.png){width=100%}

---

**Why these differences?**

::: incremental
  
  1. Party system formation during the silent revolution (i.e., more permeable party systems)
  
  2. Weaker economic development
  
  3. Lower levels of immigration
  
  4. Authoritarian legacies
  
  5. **Others?**
  
  
- The **recent** irruption of PRR parties in Portugal and Spain suggest some **degree of convergence**

::: 

## Summary

- There is an increasing agreement that a **new (mainly) cultural cleavage** is **dominating Western (European) politics**

- The cultural cleavage is largely **cross-cutting traditional cleavages**

- As a result, **elections** becoming **more unpredictable and volatile**

- However, there are important **differences across countries** and ***over time***
