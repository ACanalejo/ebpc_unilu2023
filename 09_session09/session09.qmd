# Introduction  {#sec-introduction}

## Last session recap

::: incremental

- The emergence of new parties on the left and specially on the right have led scholars to consider the **transformation of the cleavage structure in Europe**

- In the last session we viewed the increasingly accepted theory of the emergence of **new value-based cleavage** 

:::


## Last session recap

- This cleavage is rooted on social transformations following the conversion **from an industrial to a post-industrial society**:

::: incremental

  1. Changing labour market
  
  2. Expansion of education
  
  3. Globalization

:::

## Last session recap

- Because of this new cleavage, political conflict in Western Europe is said to be increasingly structured by **two** orthogonal **dimensions**

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out}

[Do you remember the **difference between cleavage and dimension**?]{style="color:red"}
:::
:::

::: incremental

- Despite regional differences, this two-dimensional space emerging from the new cleavage seems to be *the new normal* in most of Europe

:::

[But **what about the old cleavages?**]{style="color:red"}

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

[To what extent **have they lost their explanatory power?**]{style="color:red"}

::: 

# Re-alignment vs. de-alignment {#sec-alignmnent}

---

- In the beginning of the 1990s and 2000s, the belief that cleavages had lost their explanatory power became popular [@Dalton2002; @Franklin1992]

::: incremental

<br>

- It was proposed that a series of socio-structural transformations had led to a **process of de-alignment**
:::

---

**De-alignment** occurs when voters stop behaving in accordance to their ascription to a social group

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Thus, **social groups stop behaving cohesively**

::: 


---

Two main arguments:

1. Changes in the parties and medium-level organizations [(*session 10*)]{style="color:grey"}

2. **Changes in the social-structure**

---

- On the one hand, the transition from the industrial to the post-industrial society leads to the **fading of specific groups** (e.g., manual workers, active church attendants, etc.)

::: incremental

- On the other hand, the emergence of new issues cross-cutting the traditional cleavages generate ***cross-pressures***, making the vote less aligned with traditional social groups

::: 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Still today, there is a **debate** about the extent to which Western societies have experienced/ are experiencing a **process of de-alignment or re-alignment** (along the *cultural* cleavage)

::: 

# Traditional cleavages in the XXIst century {#sec-cleavages}


---

Golder [-@Goldberg2020a] analyses the extent to which the **class and religious cleavages** have lost their importance in four Western countries

::: incremental

- He differentiates between three types of de-alignment process:

  1. **Structural**: the group loses importance (i.e., group size diminishes) 

  2. **Behavioral**: the group loses predictive power for the voting choice of its members
  
  3. **Political**: electoral turnout grows asymmetrically across opposing groups

:::

[Is the so-called **structural de-alignment** a truly process of de-alignment?]{style="color:red"}

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

[How do **behavioral and political re-alignment** relate to each other? Are they **independent**?]{style="color:red"}

# Class voting today {#sec-class}

---

Is class ascription still structuring the vote today?

::: incremental

- According some, de-alignment has occurred together with re-alignment [(*session 08*)]{style="color:grey"}, and as a result we find **complex voting patterns**

- Therefore, **class** (and other social groups) **still explains the vote, but differently** [e.g., @Oesch2008]

:::


---

Oesch and Rennwald [-@Oesch2018] proposes a threefold typology of classes according to their degree of cross-pressure by different cleavages:

1. Preserves

2. Contested strongholds

3. Open competition

## To debate

<br>

[To what extent are our societies in a process of **de-alignment or re-alignment**?]{style="color:red"}

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

[What traditional cleavages do you think have weakened the most/least?]{style="color:red"}

::: 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

[If we are in a process of re-alignment along a new cleavage, **what are the social groups leading this process** (the modern *workers vs owners*)?]{style="color:red"}

## Summary

- De-alignment and re-alignment processes may be occurring together [@Marks2022]
- Transformation of traditional group-based voting (rather than evaporation) [(e.g., class)]{style="color:grey"}

- Behind these changes: transformation of the social structure [(alone?)]{style="color:grey"}
