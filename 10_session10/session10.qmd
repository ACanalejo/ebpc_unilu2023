# Introduction  {#sec-introduction}

## Notes on the evaluation of the course

<br>

- Course evaluation opened!

  → ***5th - 21st May***

## Last sessions recap

In the last weeks, we discussed:

- The weakening of traditional cleavages

- ... and the emergence of a new value-based cleavage

- As a result: 
  
  → **Tri-polar space** organized along **two -economic and cultural- dimensions**

## Last sessions recap

<br>

Main explanation so far: 

***societal transformations***

*Voters and parties are moving away from each other*

→ What does this mean?

# The withdrawal of parties {#sec-parties}

## The (political) functions of parties

<br>

1. **Representation** (government *by the people*)

2. **Accountability** (government *for the people*)

<br>

"In other words, parties – or at least the classic mass party – gave voice to the people, while also ensuring that the institutions of government were accountable." [@Mair2013]

<br>

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ According to Mair, [*what happened to these functions?*]{style="color:red"}
:::

---

"The last decades of the twentieth century witnessed a gradual but also **inexorable withdrawal of the parties from the realm of civil society towards the realm of government and the state**, and together, these two processes have led to a situation in which [***each party tends to become more distant from the voters that it purports to represent***]{style="color:red"} while at the same time tending to become [***more closely associated with the alternative protagonists against which it purports to compete.***]{style="color:red"}" [@Mair2013]

**And what about the other [mass organizations]{style="color:red"}** (e.g., church, unions, etc.)**?**

# Agency vs. structure {#sec-agency}

## Agency vs. structure

Anthony Giddens [-@giddens1984constitution]

<br>

1. ***Structure***: social conditions

2. ***Agency***: actors' free will 

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ **The actors' choices make up the structure that will later condition their future choices**
:::

---

<br>

Mair argues that the withdrawal of voters and parties is not due to some of the actors' initiative, but rather they are embedded in a pernicious loop

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ Do you agree with his interpretation? Is this more a matter of [agency or structure]{style="color:red"}?

<br>

→ Thinking about agency, [who are the agents "to blame"]{style="color:red"}?

## Response papers

<br>

"Even with the risks that populist parties bring to the political system, they can theoretically achieve what Mair wants them to: **foster change among the cartel parties and revitalize the participatory democracy**" (Samuel *Häring*)

<br>

"**Maybe new parties from the far right and left provide a suitable answer to the rigid cluster of cartel parties that formed in the middle of the spectrum.**" (Samuel *Häring*)

## To debate
