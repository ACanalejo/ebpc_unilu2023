# Myths of electoral change  {#sec-myths}

## The paper in context

Mair [-@Mair1993]

  1. The work of Lipset and Rokkan [-@Lipset1967a] on the formation of party systems and the **cleavage structure in Europe** remained **largely uncontested**
  
  2. However, there was a **huge criticism towards the freezing hypothesis** since the 1970s
  
  3. The **rise of new parties** plus patterns of **weakening party ties** and **higher electoral volatility** led many scholars to claim that party systems had indeed transformed


---

<br>


"It is not so much that Rokkan was wrong; rather, what has happened is simply that his analysis has been overtaken by events" [@Mair1993, p. 122]

<br>

RQ: **Do European party systems remain frozen?**

:::

## Three sub-questions

1. Is there **de-aligment** (i.e., decline of traditional parties)?

2. Is there **re-aligment** (i.e., growth of new parties)?

3. Is there **electoral instability** (i.e., both)?

## Two indicators

1. Electoral volatility

2. Traditional party support

## Electoral volatility

Pedersen [-@Pedersen1979] & Bartolini and Mair [-@Bartolini1990]

- **Average volatility** between 1945 and 1989: **8.7** (91.3 in stability)
  
    - **Some exceptions**: Germany in 1920 (32.1) OR France in the 1950s (22.3 in average)
  
- Importantly **higher in the inter-war period** (in which the frozen hypothesis is based on): **9.9**


## Electoral volatility

- In addition, **most volatility happens within blocks**
    
    - Average **cross-cleavage volatility** in the post-war and the interwar periods: 2.9 and 3.2 respectively
    
- Some differences across European countries, **although minor**

## Electoral volatility

"In fact, if one looks at the three broad electoral epochs which have occurred since universal suffrage and the age of mass politics - the inter-war period, the first post-war decades, and then the most recent post-war decades, **aggregate electoral volatility, aggregate electoral instability, has shown a consistent decline**" [@Mair1993, p. 124] 

## Traditional party support
    
- **95% of the vote in average in the 'frozen period'** (early 60S) compared to **84% of the vote in the 'changing period'** (late 80s and early 90s)

    
- Particularly relevant given the generational replacement and the enfranchisement of new voters


- According to Mair, ***this is a sign of stability***


::: {.fragment .fade-in}

"Even though most parties win numbers of votes, the overall loss of support shows in my opinion a clear sign of electoral change" (Micheline Perler)

## Why party systems are bias towards stability while political analyses are bias towards instability?

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

"even if trust in the old parties is declining in some cases: identification with an established party [...] leads to  [...] keeping its vote share relatively stable" (Severine Peer)

:::

## Stability vs instability bias
  
1. **Misconception of the social structure-political structure interaction** [e.g., @Franklin1992]
  
2. Underestimation of the capacity of parties to adapt
  
3. The appeal of newness


# Party system volatility in WE 1945-2015  {#sec-volatility}

## The paper in context

Emanuele & Chiaramonte [-@Chiaramonte2017]

- In the past few years, the debate on party system change has revitalized due to

  1. **dramatic volatility in SE**
  
  2. the **rise of PRR parties** in former right-wing autocracies (e.g., Germany)

::: incremental

- As a result, it is important to **re-assess** the degree of **party system stability and change** in WE

:::

## Identifying patterns of de-institutionalization in WE

- De-institutionalization = recurring high volatility

    1. Alternation volatility
    
    2. **Regeneration volatility**

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

RQ: **Have Western European** [**party-systems**]{style="color:red"} **become** [**de-institutionalized**]{style="color:red"}**?**

## Conclusion

  
- "[...] the overall picture of the levels of party system volatility and regeneration across time and space shows that the [**‘fundamental bias towards stability’**]{style="color:red"} emphasized by Bartolini and Mair (1990: 68) **appears confirmed**"

::: incremental
      
- **however**, "there is a clear increase of both variables during the last electoral period (1992–2015), with further acceleration since 2010 that reveals [**a general shift towards instability in the last years**]{style="color:red"}"

# Assessing electoral change empirically  {#sec-empirical}

## Measuring party-system change/stability

So far...

::: incremental

- Electoral volatility (cross-cleavage vs. between-cleavage/alternation vs regeneration)
  
- Traditional parties strength
  
- Party identification/membership [@Mair2013]
:::

## Measuring party-system change/stability

Others?

::: incremental
  
- Party system fragmentation
  
- Ideological polarization
  
- **Conflict dimensionality**

- ...
  
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

→ Ultimately, **it depends** on the [research question]{style="color:red"}!

## So... how much electoral change?

<br>


<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

With this in mind, is [party democracy]{style="color:red"} in [**crisis**]{style="color:red"}?

→ Is measuring change **enough to answer this question**? [What else]{style="color:red"} otherwise?
