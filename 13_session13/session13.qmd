# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

## So... how much electoral change?

<br>

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
With this in mind, is **party** [**democracy**]{style="color:red"} in [**crisis**]{style="color:red"}?
:::

<br>

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
→ Is measuring change **enough to answer this question**? [What else]{style="color:red"} otherwise?
:::

# Threat or corrective? {#sec-threat}

## Threat or corrective?

-   A debate born out from the literature on **populism** [@Kaltwasser2012; @Mudde2012a]

    1.  "Power to the people" [(e.g., direct democracy claims)]{style="color:grey"}

    2.  Disregard of liberal institutions

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   Further reinforced by the threat of **authoritarian**-oriented **leaders** [(e.g., Trump, Bolsonaro, etc.)]{style="color:grey"} [e.g., @Norris2019]
:::

## Beyond the populist challenge

-   Dis-anchorage of the voter-party linkages [e.g., @Mair2013]

    → Fear of parties becoming mere electoral marketers

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   Higher party system fragmentation leading to:

    → Instability and lowering **democratic quality** [(e.g., weak coalitions, poor policy choices, etc.)]{style="color:grey"}

    → Radicalisation and **polarization** [(ideological and **affective**)]{style="color:grey"}
:::

# Polarization and party system change {#sec-polarization}

## Radical party entry and polarization

Bischof & Wagner [-@Bischof2019]

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
The paper provides causal evidence of whether radical party entry increases **ideological polarization**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
It suggests two mechanisms:

1.  **Legitimization** (i.e. signalling of social norm change)

2.  **Backlash** (i.e. reaction)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   It concludes that the entry of **radical right-wing parties increases polarization** via the two abovementioned mechanisms in the **short and long-term**

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   It provides **evidence from three complementary studies**:

    1.  LPF in the Netherlands 2002 with panel data

    2.  Eurobarometer with TSCS data and two-way fixed effects models

    3.  Eurobarometer with TSCS data and synthetic control methods

## Response papers

"I believe exploring the process of radical parties entering party systems and creating polarisation is certainly valuable, but **it could be so much more significant if we were to understand how these parties create polarisation in order to gain political success.**" (George O'Carroll)

## Response papers

"I will give focus to the **lack of research and salience given to centrist voters** and whether these voters tend to follow the legitimatize or backlash hypothesis" (Leon Gallagher)

<br>

"They did say “entrance of the LPF also led to an abandonment of the centre.” (Bischoff & Wagner, 2019) but **does this mean that centrist voters polarized in either directions or that the parties that considered themselves ‘centre’ change their political ideology with the introduction of the far-right party?**" (Leon Gallagher)


# Democratic quality and party system change {#sec-quality}

## PS fragmentation and the quality of democracy

Valentim & Dinas [-@Valentim2020a]

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
The paper provides causal evidence of whether party system fragmentation affects the **quality of democracy**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
It focuses on several **dimensions**:

|                              |                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Accountability               | Instability            |
| Corruption                   | Participation          |
| Representation of minorities | Public goods provision |
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   It concludes that **higher party system fragmentation** **do not affect** the **quality of democracy** unless in highly polarized party systems [(where the effect is positive on average)]{style="color:grey"}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   Methodologically, it innovates using an **IV approach**:

    1.  It exploits quasi-random variation in the number of parties around legally fixed electoral thresholds

    2.  Then it construct counter-factual PS fragmentation measures for 320 elections in 38 countries

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

## Is electoral change good or bad for democracy?

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Are our democracies [better off]{style="color:red"} now [than]{style="color:red"} they were [before]{style="color:red"}? Is this due to electoral changes or something else?
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
How can we assess these questions [empirically]{style="color:red"}? What are the [relevant dimensions]{style="color:red"}?
:::
