# An introduction to replication {#sec-introduction}

## What is replication?

- Conducting a previous study with **sufficiently similar methods** and under **sufficiently similar circumstances**

- **Different types**:

  1. Systematic repetition of the same analysis over the same data
  
  2. Additional analyses over the same data
  
  3. Same analyses over new data

  4. Additional but related analyses over new but related data

## Why is replication important?

- Crucial for science because of:

  1. **Verifiability**
  
  2. **Validity**
  
  3. Definition of the **scope conditions** of an argument


# The replication exercise {#sec-replication}

## Why are we doing it?

1. Because **we can** (so you can do it at home!)

2. **To validate** some of the claims we have discussed so far empirically

3. Maybe, even **to discover** something new

## Our replication exercise

- We will focus on the most used indicator to assess party system change: **electoral volatility**

- Specifically, we will use the data produced by Vincenzo Emanuele [-@Emanuele2015] on **electoral volatility in Western Europe from 1945 to 2015**

- This is one of the dataset that he and his colleagues use to analyze party system change [e.g., @Chiaramonte2017]

## R and RStudio

- **R** is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics with a vast collection of packages, all of them open source

- **RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically suited for R 

- It is also **free and open source**

- In addition, it **supports other languages** too (these slides have been done with reveals.js in RStudio!)

## Let's get started!
